***MaeGPT***

**MaeGPT** is a GUI to interact with the *OpenAI API* library written using *PyQt5* & *MongoDB*.

**Includes**: 
-General chat
-Image generation 
-Custom truncation and recall backend
-Custom instruction sets

Place a "**config.py**" file in the root directory of the project containing the string:

**API_KEY = 'Your API Key'**


Currently a local **MongoDB** instance **(i.e. mongodb://localhost:27017)** is required for proper functionality and recall.
